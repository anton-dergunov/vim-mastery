# CodeMirror Vim patches

`patch-package` runs after dependency installation and applies only
version-specific files named `@replit+codemirror-vim+<version>.patch`.

No upstream patch is needed for the initial Visual Block failure: it was caused
by the host editor omitting CodeMirror's `allowMultipleSelections` extension.
When a native-Vim fixture demonstrates an upstream engine mismatch, add the
smallest patch here and reference the fixture in its header and in
`docs/vim-conformance.md`.
