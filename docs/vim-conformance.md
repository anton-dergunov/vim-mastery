# Vim Conformance

Vim Wilds renders with CodeMirror and interprets commands through
`@replit/codemirror-vim`. The supported-command contract is not inferred from
the package's advertised coverage: each command family needs a native Vim
fixture and a browser fixture for physical and virtual input.

Run `npm test` to execute the current native-Vim and Chromium checks. The
browser tests use Google Chrome on macOS; on another platform, configure a
Playwright Chromium executable before running them.

`supported-commands.json` is the release gate. A command moves from pending to
verified only with fixture coverage for text, cursor/selection, mode, registers
when relevant, and undo grouping when relevant. Package defects are patched
with `patch-package`, kept version-specific under `patches/`, and linked to the
fixture that demonstrates the upstream mismatch.
